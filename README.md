This video features the RacingMouse being used in the commercial video game Drift21. The game features a test course that the player can drift around using the controller and a keyboard. Its purpose is to test your skills before you move onto actual timed races. The controller has inputs for acceleration, braking, and steering. Compared to using a typical mouse in your right hand, this controller gives a much more precise feeling experience. It allows the PC player to actually have sufficient levels of control over their car, while still retaining access to a keyboard.
