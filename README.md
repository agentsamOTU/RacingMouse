Our electronic components were soldered directly to a prototype board. The joystick and prototype board both had slots to fit into modelled on our bottom piece. In addition, the joystick, prototype board, and arduino were all hot glued to the base as well. For Wire Management we mostly had to worry about wires getting in the way of our buttons. We were able to route any wires on that side of the board through our middle channel. Additionally, the use of solid core wire allowed us to more reliably shape our wires' paths.

This video features the RacingMouse being used in the commercial video game Drift21. The game features a test course that the player can drift around using the controller and a keyboard. Its purpose is to test your skills before you move onto actual timed races. The controller has inputs for acceleration, braking, and steering. Compared to using a typical mouse in your right hand, this controller gives a much more precise feeling experience. It allows the PC player to actually have sufficient levels of control over their car, while still retaining access to a keyboard. Additionally, the mouse has two leds that increase in brightness as the accelerate and brake buttons are pushed further down.
